# Josh Salazar
**Title:** Front-End Developer

**When I joined D&D:** March 28, 2023

**How I describe my work to someone unfamiliar with the type of work I do:**  
Self-proclaimed JavaScript connoisseur, CSS wrangler, and HTML aficionado. I spend most of my time using magic ðŸª„ to create websites. I have a particular interest in creating websites that everyone can use, especially those with disabilities. I love all things digital design ðŸŽ¨ and use that interest to help me make websites that aren't only functional, but beautiful too.

**My communication preferences:**  
I love people and I love chatting, so please don't hesitate to reach out and ask a question or just chat about some cool new JavaScript library you're playing with. As of writing this, I'm still relatively new to the team so I'm still establishing my communication practices that fit well with the team (//TODO: fix me!) so I'll circle back and revise this later. For now, I'm finding Slack to be the go-to for quick communication and email for longer longer messages and things that don't require my immediate attention.

I do have pickup and dropoff times on my calendar where I'm usually driving to and from school for the kiddos. I've used those times to have voice conversations but usually don't have time to respond to text-based messages.

**Favorite hobbies:**  
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸ and piano ðŸŽ¹
- Reading ðŸ“š
- Sailing â›µ and windsurfing ðŸŒŠ (come join me for a summer sail!)
- Video games ðŸŽ® and board games ðŸŽ²

**Favorite snacks:**  
Believe it or not, I'm not a big food person. But my daughter's entire existance is just distrating herself until her next meal. Just the other day she said "I'm already hungry for breakfast tomorrow". She's 5, for reference.

**I am grateful for:** My family! They're my muse.

**One adjective to describe me:** Compassionate
