# Josh Salazar
**Title:** Front-End Developer

**When I joined D&D:** March 28, 2023

**How I describe my work to someone unfamiliar with the type of work I do:**  
I spend most of my time using magic ðŸª„ to create websites. I have a particular interest in creating websites that everyone can use. I love all things digital design ðŸŽ¨ and use that interest to help me make websites that aren't only functional, but beautiful too.

**My communication preferences:**  
I love people and I love chatting, so please don't hesitate to reach out and ask a question or just chat about some cool new JavaScript library you're playing with. As of writing this, I'm still relatively new to the team so I'm still establishing my communication practices that fit well with the team. For now, I'm finding Slack to be the go-to for quick communication and email for longer messages and things that don't require my immediate attention.

**Favorite hobbies:**  
- Playing guitar ðŸŽ¸ and piano ðŸŽ¹
- Reading ðŸ“š
- Sailing â›µ and windsurfing ðŸŒŠ (come join me for a summer sail!)
- Video games ðŸŽ® and board games ðŸŽ²

**I am grateful for:** My family! They're my muse.

**One adjective to describe me:** Compassionate
